1 Multiples of 3 or 5
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

    Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
    Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

3 Array.diff
    Implement a function that computes the difference between two lists. The function should remove all occurrences of elements from the first list (a) that are present in the second list (b). The order of elements in the first list should be preserved in the result.

    Examples
    If a = [1, 2] and b = [1], the result should be [2].
    If a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] and b = [2], the result should be [1, 3].
